# SiliconMind
This is a project to create a voltage control keyboard for Eurorack Synths.  The aim is to create a fourvoice polyhtonic keyboard, with no MIDI at all.

The hardware is based around the ATMEGA.

Software 

SiliconMind.ion is latest for aec-pcb1 First PCB hardware

                  Work in progress, in test !

Hardware Designs:

Pure Keys aec Original Design

Pure Keys aec-pcb1 First PCB  do not use

      	       Needs pull down resistors on	MK lines
                   5V Ref needs	 replacing with 3v version
                   Switch needs	 pull up, not down.
Pure Keys aec-pcb2-inProgress. 

                   Next design work	in progress, changes in pcb1 are rolled into this
                   Do not use until Pure Keys aec-pcb2 is ready
